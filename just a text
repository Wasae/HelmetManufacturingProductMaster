js suggestions to avaoid :																									
1. Make Js Unobtrusive (to make UI seperate from js completely basically seperation of concerns)																									
2. avoid selecting same elements repeatedly(Basically cache DOM elements)																									
3. Code in Modular Pattern (So that every module is responsible for only one Set of functionalities)																									
4. Load everything on very first request,so that multiple request can be avoided and It becomes SPA																									
5. Not to use Ajax anywhere directly,will have a common module from which ajax related code will written to avoid sphagetti code(Tyring to clean the code)																									
6. All Dropdwon related Options should be cached and should be use as and when required.																									
7. Proper Rowid generation and tracking of such rowids for tables for easy and fast data retreival(when collecting from complex dynamictable or forms)																									
8. load all extra js in defer mode so that page can load faster(DOM Parsing and Scripts downloading in parallel and then script execution)																									
9. Handling filters on clientside if data is less.(Just make it fast and avoidng extra request)																									
10. Will try to make it fully in vanilla js so that no other extra reference will be added and its dowloading time will reduce and page will load comparatively faster.
